# MinorStrokeMetaanalysis

This will be the Repository for the R script to perform a meta-analysis in the field of Minor Stroke.

The plan is to use the 
- Packages dmetar, meta, and metafor
- Random effects model
- Mantel-Haenzel method

... to calculate a pooled odds ratio.

I will measure heterogeneity by calculating Q, I^2, and tau-squared.
A metaregression will be performed if there is high heterogeneity.
